     -d '{
       "image_data": "<base64_encoded_screenshot>",
       "suggestion_type": "opener",
       "tone": "playful"
     }'
   ```

3. **Validate Response**
   - ‚úÖ All 5 required fields present
   - ‚úÖ `reasoning` and `references` in every suggestion
   - ‚úÖ Appropriate `profile_score`
   - ‚úÖ Logical `needs_more_scrolling` decision
   - ‚úÖ Suggestions are contextual and personalized

4. **Record Results**
   - Screenshot filename
