# üöÄ START HERE - Next Session Guide

**READ THIS BEFORE DOING ANYTHING**

## üîë IMPORTANT: Branch Information

**Current Branch**: `fix/production-ready-clean`
**Remote**: `origin/fix/production-ready-clean`

This is a clean branch created without secret history. The original branch `fix/production-ready-2025-09-27` has detailed commit history but contains secrets in git history, so we created this clean version for safe remote push.

## ‚úÖ Orientation (MANDATORY - Do This First)

1. **Read this entire file first** (you're doing it!)
2. **Read `docs/README.md`** - Project overview
3. **Read `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`** - Current bugs and priorities
4. **Review `CLAUDE.md`** - Latest session summary

## üìö Documentation Policy (STRICT RULES)

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Update existing docs in `docs/` folder
- Update `CLAUDE.md` at end of session only
- Add new documentation to `docs/` (if absolutely necessary, max 10 files total)
- Archive old docs to `.archive/` if needed

### ‚ùå DO NOT:
- Create `SESSION_*`, `STATUS_*`, `REPORT_*`, `HANDOFF_*` files
- Create .md files outside `docs/` folder (except CLAUDE.md, README.md, this file)
- Create test evidence files scattered around (use `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`)
- Create multiple session summaries (update `CLAUDE.md` only)

**Why?** Previous sessions created 889+ markdown files causing impossible navigation. We cleaned it up (216 files archived). Don't recreate the mess.

**Enforced by:**
- Claude Code hooks (warn during session)
- Git pre-commit hook (blocks at commit time)

## üéØ Your Mission This Session

### Priority 1: Test This Session's Work
**Goal:** Validate the cleanup actually works

**Tasks:**
1. **Build iOS app in Xcode**
   ```bash
   cd iOS
   open Flirrt.xcodeproj
   # Build for simulator
   ```

2. **Test Main App UI**
   - Launch in simulator
   - ‚úÖ Check "How to Use" guide appears (not placeholder buttons)
   - ‚úÖ Test "Open Keyboard Settings" button works

3. **Test Keyboard Memory**
   - Enable keyboard in Settings
   - Switch to Flirrt keyboard in Messages
   - Monitor memory usage (should stay <40MB, target <30MB)

### Priority 2: Debug Screenshot Detection
**Current Issue:** Darwin notifications not reaching keyboard reliably

**Debug Steps:**
1. Add logging to `FlirrtApp.swift` screenshot detection (line ~50)
2. Add logging to `KeyboardViewController.swift` Darwin notification receiver (line ~1710)
3. Take screenshot in simulator (Cmd+S)
4. Check Xcode console for logs
5. Identify where notification chain breaks

**Expected Flow:**
```
Screenshot taken
‚Üí UIApplication.userDidTakeScreenshotNotification
‚Üí Main app receives it
‚Üí Posts Darwin notification "com.flirrt.screenshot.detected"
‚Üí Keyboard receives Darwin notification
‚Üí Switches button to "Analyze" mode
```

### Priority 3: Fix Keyboard-Backend API
**Current Issue:** "Network unavailable" errors

**Debug Steps:**
1. Start backend: `cd Backend && npm start`
2. Test health: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
3. Check keyboard URL configuration in `KeyboardViewController.swift`
4. Verify "Allow Full Access" enabled in Settings
5. Test with both localhost and Mac IP address

## üö´ What NOT To Do

1. **Do NOT reorganize code** without user explicitly asking
2. **Do NOT create new documentation files** (update existing)
3. **Do NOT "clean up" or "improve"** unless it's broken
4. **Do NOT make assumptions** about what user wants
5. **Do NOT bypass the pre-commit hook** without understanding why it failed

## üé® Testing Checklist

Use this to track your validation:

- [ ] iOS app builds successfully
- [ ] Main app launches without crashes
- [ ] "How to Use" guide displays (no placeholder buttons)
- [ ] "Open Keyboard Settings" button works
- [ ] Keyboard extension loads in Settings
- [ ] Keyboard displays UI in Messages app
- [ ] Memory stays under 40MB during usage
- [ ] Backend health check passes
- [ ] No documentation bloat created

## üìñ Quick Reference

- **All documentation**: `docs/` folder
- **Current bugs**: `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`
- **Setup guide**: `docs/SETUP.md`
- **API reference**: `docs/API.md`
- **Session history**: `CLAUDE.md`
- **Archived files**: `.archive/` (ignore these)
- **Main app views**: `iOS/Flirrt/Views/`
- **Keyboard code**: `iOS/FlirrtKeyboard/KeyboardViewController.swift`
- **Backend server**: `Backend/server.js`

## üÜò If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Read error messages carefully**
2. **Check `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`** for known problems
3. **Review recent commits**: `git log --oneline -5`
4. **Rollback if needed**: `git checkout pre-cleanup-backup`

## üí° Communication with User

- **Be concise** - User prefers short, direct responses
- **Ask before major changes** - Don't assume
- **Update docs** - Don't create new files
- **Focus on the goal** - Testing and debugging, not reorganizing

## üìä What Was Fixed This Session

1. ‚úÖ Archived 216 legacy files
2. ‚úÖ Created clean `docs/` structure (7 files)
3. ‚úÖ Removed 3 placeholder buttons ‚Üí "How to Use" guide
4. ‚úÖ Added "Open Keyboard Settings" button
5. ‚úÖ Removed redundant PHPhotoLibrary observer (~8MB saved)

7. ‚úÖ Created hooks to prevent documentation bloat

## üéØ Verification Required

Before you start new work, verify these claims:
- Root directory has only 3 .md files (CLAUDE.md, README.md, this file)
- docs/ folder has exactly 7 files
- ContentView.swift has "How to Use" guide (no TODO buttons)
- KeyboardViewController.swift has NO PHPhotoLibrary.register() calls
- .archive/ contains 216 files

Run this to verify:
```bash
find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" | wc -l  # Should be 3
ls docs/*.md | wc -l                      # Should be 7
grep -c "Open Keyboard Settings" iOS/Flirrt/Views/ContentView.swift  # Should be 1+
grep -c "PHPhotoLibrary.register" iOS/FlirrtKeyboard/KeyboardViewController.swift  # Should be 0
find .archive/2025-10-pre-cleanup -type f | wc -l  # Should be 216
```
