## Text Processing & Optimization

### Pre-Processing Rules
**Punctuation Enhancement**:
- Add strategic pauses: "Well..." â†’ "Well... [pause:0.5]"
- Emphasis markers: "really" â†’ "*really*" for natural stress
- Question inflection: Ensure proper rising tone for questions

**Natural Speech Patterns**:
- Convert written contractions: "cannot" â†’ "can't"
- Add filler words for authenticity: "I mean," "you know," "honestly"
- Break up long sentences with natural breathing points

**Flirt-Specific Adjustments**:
- Emphasize compliments with slight pitch variation
- Add subtle pauses before punchlines or reveals
- Ensure playful teasing has appropriate tone lightness

### Emotion-Specific Processing

**Confident Tone**:
- Slightly slower pace for authority
- Clear pronunciation with strong consonants
- Minimal filler words, direct delivery
- Example adjustment: "I think you're amazing" â†’ "You're *amazing*"

**Playful Tone**:
- Varied pitch for expressiveness
- Quicker pace with emphasis on humor beats
- Natural laugh-like inflections where appropriate
- Example: "Oh really?" â†’ "Oh *really*? [slight chuckle]"

**Warm Tone**:
- Softer consonants, flowing delivery
- Gentle emphasis on emotional words
- Longer pauses for intimacy
- Example: "That's beautiful" â†’ "[gentle] That's... *beautiful*"

**Sultry Tone**:
- Lower pitch register, slower delivery
- Breathy quality on intimate words
- Strategic pauses for effect
- Example: "Interesting" â†’ "[lower, slower] *Interesting*..."
