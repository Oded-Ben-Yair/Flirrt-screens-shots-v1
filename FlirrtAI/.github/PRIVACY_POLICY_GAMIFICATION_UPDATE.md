## Technical Details for Privacy-Conscious Users

### Local Storage Implementation

**Technology**: Apple UserDefaults (iOS native key-value store)

**Storage Keys Used**:
```
gamification.totalPoints          ‚Üí Int
gamification.currentStreak         ‚Üí Int
gamification.lastVisitDate         ‚Üí Date
gamification.hasUsedStreakFreeze   ‚Üí Bool
gamification.lastStreakFreezeResetDate ‚Üí Date
gamification.unlockedTiers         ‚Üí JSON (Set<String>)
gamification.achievedMilestones    ‚Üí JSON (Array<String>)
gamification.enabled               ‚Üí Bool
gamification.tutorialCompleted     ‚Üí Bool
```

**Security**:
- UserDefaults is sandboxed per app (other apps can't access it)
- Not encrypted by default (but device encryption applies if enabled)
- Backed up to iCloud if iCloud Backup enabled (under your control)
- Removed when app is deleted

**Network Transmission**: Zero bytes of gamification data transmitted

**Third-Party Access**: None (all local)

### Future CloudKit Sync (v2.1+)

In a future update, we plan to offer **optional** CloudKit sync:
- Sync points/streak across your devices (iPhone, iPad)
- Requires iCloud account
- Stored in your personal iCloud container
- We cannot access your iCloud data
- Completely optional (local-only will remain available)

When we launch CloudKit sync:
- We'll update this privacy policy
- Prompt you to opt-in
- Clearly explain what syncs
- Default to OFF (you choose to enable)

## Transparency Commitment

We believe in radical transparency about data:

   - It's more private (we don't see it)
   - It works offline
   - You have full control

2. **Future Plans**: If we ever change this (e.g., CloudKit sync):
   - We'll announce it prominently
   - Make it opt-in only
   - Update this policy clearly
   - Give you 30 days notice before any changes

3. **Our Promise**:
   - We will NEVER sell your gamification data
   - We will NEVER use it for advertising without consent
   - We will NEVER share it with third parties
   - We will NEVER require server sync (local-only option stays)

## Summary

**Gamification v2.0 Privacy in One Sentence**:

*All gamification data (points, streaks, achievements) stays on your device only‚Äîwe never see it, never transmit it, and you can delete it anytime.*
