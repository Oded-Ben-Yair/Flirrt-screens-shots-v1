## Technical Architecture Summary

### Gamification System Design

**State Management**:
- Observation framework (`@Observable`)
- Property-level reactivity
- `@MainActor` isolation for thread safety

**Persistence**:
- UserDefaults for all gamification data
- Local-only storage (no server sync in v2.0)
- Keys prefixed with `gamification.*`

**Performance Optimization**:
- Pre-calculated reveal thresholds (computed once on view appear)
- Discrete blur levels (5 fixed values: 20, 15, 10, 5, 0)
- Batched state updates (only when progress changes >5%)
- Lazy loading with viewport detection
- 60fps target achieved through optimization

**Points Economy**:
| Action | Base Points | Multiplied by Streak |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Scroll reveal | 10 | Yes |
| Copy flirt | 25 | Yes |
| Rate flirt | 50 | Yes |
| Generate flirts | 100 | Yes |
| Daily login | 200 | No |

**Streak System**:
| Streak Days | Multiplier | Flames |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| 1-2 | 1x | 🔥 |
| 3-6 | 2x | 🔥🔥 |
| 7+ | 3x | 🔥🔥🔥 |

**Milestones**:
| Milestone | Flirts Revealed | Reward | Icon |
|-----------|----------------|--------|------|
| Explorer | 10 | +100 pts | 🎯 |
| Connoisseur | 50 | +500 pts | 🎭 |
| Master | 100 | +1500 pts | 👑 |

**Quality Tiers**:
| Tier | Unlock Requirement | Score Range |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| Bronze | Always unlocked | 65-74% |
| Silver | 3 flirts revealed | 75-84% |
| Gold | 6 flirts OR 500 pts | 85-94% |
| Platinum | 10 flirts OR 3-day streak | 95-100% |
