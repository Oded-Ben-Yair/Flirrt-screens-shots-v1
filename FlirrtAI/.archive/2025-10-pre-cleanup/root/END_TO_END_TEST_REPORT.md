## 🔍 KEY FINDINGS

### ✅ WHAT WORKS WELL

1. **Image Analysis Accuracy**:
   - AI correctly identified "adventurous vibe" from outdoor photos
   - High confidence scores (0.85) for successful generations
   - Contextually relevant flirt suggestions

2. **API Performance**:
   - Successful requests completed in 13-19 seconds
   - Proper error handling with correlation IDs
   - Good response format with confidence metrics

3. **App Infrastructure**:
   - Clean installation process
   - Keyboard extension properly installed
   - Messages app integration ready

### ⚠️ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

1. **Large Image Handling**:

   - Need image compression before API call
   - Timeout threshold may need adjustment

2. **Response Caching**:
   - Similar photos generating identical responses
   - "Real AI: No" indicates caching issues
   - May need unique context generation

3. **App Launch Issues**:
   - Main app launch failed (service delegate error)
   - Keyboard extension works independently
   - Bundle ID confusion (com.flirrt.app vs com.flirrt.ai)
