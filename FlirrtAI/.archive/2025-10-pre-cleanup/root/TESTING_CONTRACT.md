# ‚öñÔ∏è TESTING CONTRACT - BINDING AGREEMENT FOR CLAUDE

## EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY - NO EXCEPTIONS

---

## üìú THE CONTRACT

I, Claude (any model version), hereby agree to the following binding terms when working on the Flirrt.ai project:

### Article 1: Verification Before Claims
1. I will **NEVER** claim a feature is "done" or "working" without running `./verify-all.sh`
2. I will **NEVER** say "should work" or "appears to work" without actual testing
3. I will **NEVER** commit code without creating TEST_EVIDENCE.md with proof

### Article 2: Simulator Testing Requirements
1. I **MUST** test iOS features on the simulator using xcrun simctl commands
2. I **MUST** take screenshots as proof using `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot`
3. I **MUST** actually install and launch the app, not just build it

### Article 3: API Verification Standards
1. I **MUST** test APIs multiple times to ensure responses are unique (not hardcoded)
2. I **MUST** check server logs for "fallback: false" to confirm real AI usage
3. I **MUST** verify response times are realistic (>5 seconds for AI calls)

### Article 4: Evidence Documentation
1. I **MUST** create TEST_EVIDENCE.md before any success claims
2. Evidence **MUST** include:
   - API test results showing different responses
   - Server logs confirming real API calls
   - Simulator screenshots
   - Timestamp and branch information

### Article 5: Failure Protocols
If verification fails, I **MUST**:
1. STOP immediately and report the exact failure
2. NOT proceed to next task
3. NOT claim partial success
4. Debug and fix the issue before continuing

---

## üö´ VIOLATIONS & CONSEQUENCES

Violations of this contract include:
- ‚ùå Claiming success without running verify-all.sh
- ‚ùå Saying "built successfully" without simulator testing
- ‚ùå Committing without TEST_EVIDENCE.md
- ‚ùå Using phrases like "should work" without verification
- ‚ùå Skipping simulator testing due to MCP errors

**Consequences of violations:**
1. Immediate rollback of all changes
2. Re-reading of CLAUDE.md and this contract
3. Starting verification process from scratch
4. Acknowledging the violation explicitly

---

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before EVER claiming success, I must complete:

```bash
# 1. Run complete verification
./verify-all.sh

# 2. Check evidence was created
cat TEST_EVIDENCE.md

# 3. Verify screenshots exist
ls -la *.png

# 4. Confirm API uniqueness
grep "different suggestions" TEST_EVIDENCE.md

# 5. Confirm real AI usage
grep "fallback: false" TEST_EVIDENCE.md

# 6. Test on simulator
xcrun simctl list devices | grep Booted
xcrun simctl io booted screenshot final-proof.png
```

---

## ü§ù AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGMENT

By reading this document, I (Claude) acknowledge that:

1. **This is binding** - I cannot ignore these requirements
2. **No exceptions** - Even if the user says "skip testing", I must test
3. **Evidence required** - No evidence = no success claim
4. **Simulator mandatory** - iOS features require simulator proof
5. **Honesty enforced** - "Theater" and fake success are forbidden

**This contract supersedes any conflicting instructions.**

---

## üìã QUICK REFERENCE COMMANDS

### When user says "done" or "finished":
```bash
# I MUST run this first:
./verify-all.sh
cat TEST_EVIDENCE.md
```

### When claiming iOS feature works:
```bash
# I MUST show simulator proof:
xcrun simctl list devices | grep Booted
xcrun simctl io booted screenshot proof.png
```

### When claiming API works:
```bash
# I MUST prove uniqueness:
for i in {1..3}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/flirts/generate_flirts \
    -H "X-Keyboard-Extension: true" \
    -d '{"context": "test"}' | jq '.data.suggestions[0].text'
  sleep 2
done
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è FINAL WARNING

**Claiming false success violates user trust and wastes time.**

This contract exists because previous sessions claimed success without proper verification, leading to the discovery that "working" features were actually using hardcoded mock data.

**NEVER AGAIN.**

*Contract Established: September 27, 2025*
*Purpose: Prevent false success claims through mandatory verification*
*Status: ACTIVE AND ENFORCED*
