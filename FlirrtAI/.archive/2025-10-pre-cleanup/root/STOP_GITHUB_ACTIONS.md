# ðŸ›‘ HOW TO STOP THE GITHUB ACTIONS FAILURE EMAILS

## Option 1: Via GitHub Website (EASIEST)

1. Go to: https://github.com/oded-ben-yair/Flirrt-screens-shots-v1
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Look for any workflows listed
4. Click on each workflow
5. Click the "..." menu â†’ "Disable workflow"

## Option 2: Delete All Workflows

If there are workflow files in your repository:

```bash
# List all workflow files
git ls-files .github/workflows/

# If any exist, delete them:
git rm -r .github/workflows/
git commit -m "Remove all GitHub Actions workflows"
git push origin main
```

## Option 3: Check if Someone Else Set It Up

The workflows might be configured:
- By a collaborator
- In repository settings (not in code)
- As scheduled workflows that run automatically

## Why You're Getting Emails:

Based on my analysis, there are NO workflow files in your current code.
This means either:
1. Workflows are configured directly on GitHub.com
2. They're in a different branch
3. Someone else set them up

## To Find Out:

Go to: https://github.com/oded-ben-yair/Flirrt-screens-shots-v1/actions

You'll see what's actually running and can disable it from there.
