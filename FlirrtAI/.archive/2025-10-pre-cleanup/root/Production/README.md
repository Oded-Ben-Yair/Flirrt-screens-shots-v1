   - Blue-green deployment orchestration
   - PostgreSQL and Redis database setup
   - Load balancer configuration with health checks

3. **🧪 TestingAgent** - Comprehensive Production Validation
   - End-to-end AI agent workflow testing
   - API endpoint validation and load testing
   - Performance benchmark verification (< 2s response times)
   - Security penetration testing

4. **📊 MonitoringAgent** - Real-time Observability
   - Comprehensive metrics collection (system, application, agents)
   - Real-time health monitoring with alerting
   - Production dashboard with live visualizations
   - Log aggregation and analysis

5. **🔒 SecurityAgent** - Security & Compliance Validation
   - API security validation (authentication, rate limiting)
   - SSL/TLS configuration verification
   - AI safety filter and content moderation testing
   - GDPR/CCPA compliance verification

## 🚀 One-Command Deployment

Deploy the entire Flirrt.ai system to production with a single command:

```bash
# Full production deployment with celebration
node deploy-production.js

# Dry run (test without making changes)
node deploy-production.js --dry-run

# Skip iOS build (backend only)
