## Required Info.plist Permissions

Add the following to your main app's Info.plist:

```xml
<!-- REQUIRED: Microphone access -->
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Flirrt needs access to your microphone to record voice samples for creating personalized voice clones. This enables the app to generate flirty messages in your own voice.</string>

<!-- OPTIONAL: Background audio processing -->
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

## Integration Steps

### 1. Add to Your Main App

```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct YourApp: App {
    @StateObject private var authManager = AuthManager()
    @StateObject private var apiClient = APIClient()
    @StateObject private var sharedDataManager = SharedDataManager()

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environmentObject(authManager)
                .environmentObject(apiClient)
                .environmentObject(sharedDataManager)
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Present Voice Recording View

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingVoiceRecording = false

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                Button("Record Voice") {
                    showingVoiceRecording = true
                }
                .sheet(isPresented: $showingVoiceRecording) {
                    VoiceRecordingView()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Using VoiceRecordingManager Programmatically

```swift
import SwiftUI

class MyViewController: UIViewController {
    private let voiceManager = VoiceRecordingManager()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        setupVoiceRecording()
    }

    private func setupVoiceRecording() {
        // Check permissions
        voiceManager.checkPermissions()

        // Request permissions if needed
        Task {
            if voiceManager.permissionStatus != .granted {
                let granted = await voiceManager.requestPermissions()
                if !granted {
                    // Handle permission denied
                    return
                }
            }
        }
    }

    @IBAction func startRecording() {
        Task {
            await voiceManager.startRecording()
        }
    }

    @IBAction func stopRecording() {
        voiceManager.stopRecording()
    }

    @IBAction func uploadVoiceClone() {
        Task {
            do {
                let response = try await voiceManager.uploadVoiceClone(userId: "user123")
                print("Voice clone created: \(response.voiceId)")

                // Store voice ID
                UserDefaults.standard.set(response.voiceId, forKey: "user_voice_id")
            } catch {
                print("Upload failed: \(error)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing

To test the voice recording module:

1. **Permission Testing**: Test on device with microphone access granted/denied
2. **Recording Quality**: Test in various environments (quiet/noisy)
3. **Duration Limits**: Test minimum (5s) and maximum (3min) durations
4. **Network Testing**: Test upload with poor/no connectivity
5. **Memory Testing**: Test with multiple recordings
6. **Background Testing**: Test app backgrounding during recording

## Dependencies

- **AVFoundation**: Core audio recording and playback
- **Alamofire**: Network requests for ElevenLabs API
- **SwiftUI**: Modern UI framework
- **Combine**: Reactive data flow

## Notes

- The module is designed as a Swift Package Manager library
- All recordings are stored locally in the app's Documents directory
- Voice IDs are stored securely in UserDefaults and Keychain
- Real-time audio levels are captured for waveform visualization
- The module supports app groups for sharing data between extensions
- Background audio processing requires additional Info.plist configuration
- ElevenLabs API integration requires valid API credentials in APIClient

## Security Considerations

- ðŸ”’ Microphone permissions are properly requested and handled
- ðŸ”’ Voice recordings are stored locally and uploaded securely
- ðŸ”’ API requests use HTTPS with proper certificate validation
- ðŸ”’ Voice IDs are stored in secure UserDefaults
- ðŸ”’ No sensitive data is logged in production builds
- ðŸ”’ Temporary files are properly cleaned up after upload
