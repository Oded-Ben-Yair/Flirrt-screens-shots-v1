## üîß MANUAL STEP: Add File to Xcode

### Instructions:

1. **Open Xcode:**
   ```bash
   open iOS/Vibe8.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **In Project Navigator, locate:**
   - Vibe8 (main app)
   - ‚Üí Vibe8 (folder)
   - ‚Üí Services (folder)

3. **Right-click on "Services" folder:**
   - Select "Add Files to 'Vibe8'..."

4. **Navigate to and select:**
   ```
   iOS/Vibe8/Services/ScreenshotCaptureService.swift
   ```

5. **In the dialog that appears:**
   - ‚úÖ Check: "Copy items if needed" (if not already checked)
   - ‚úÖ Check: "Create groups"
   - ‚úÖ Select target: **Vibe8** (main app ONLY)
   - ‚ùå Uncheck: Vibe8Keyboard
   - ‚ùå Uncheck: Vibe8Share

6. **Click "Add"**

7. **Verify:**
   - File appears in Project Navigator under Vibe8/Services/
   - File is blue (part of project), not gray (reference only)

---

## üß™ TEST BUILD

After adding the file:

```bash
cd iOS
xcodebuild -project Vibe8.xcodeproj -scheme Vibe8 -sdk iphonesimulator clean build
```

**Expected:** `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`

If build fails:
- Check that ScreenshotCaptureService.swift is in the Vibe8 target (not keyboard)
- Check that file shows up in Build Phases ‚Üí Compile Sources
- Make sure App Groups entitlements are properly configured

---

## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

After adding the file, verify:

- [ ] ScreenshotCaptureService.swift appears in Xcode Project Navigator
- [ ] File is blue (not gray) in Project Navigator
- [ ] File is in Vibe8 target only (not keyboard or share extension)
- [ ] Build succeeds with no errors
- [ ] App Groups entitlements are configured (already done ‚úÖ):
  - Main app: `group.com.vibe8` ‚úÖ
  - Keyboard: `group.com.vibe8` ‚úÖ

---

## üöÄ AFTER COMPLETION

Once the file is added and build succeeds, you're ready for **CP-2: KeyboardKit Integration**.

**Next prompt to send:**

```
CP-1 Xcode configuration complete. ScreenshotCaptureService added to project. Build succeeded. Ready for CP-2: KeyboardKit Integration.
```

Then I'll begin CP-2:
- Install KeyboardKit 9.9 via Swift Package Manager
- Create Vibe8KeyboardViewController with full QWERTY
- Add custom suggestion toolbar
- Enable iOS 26 Liquid Glass design

---

## üìä CURRENT STATUS

**Project Progress:** ~12% complete
**CP-1:** ‚úÖ 100% COMPLETE (pending manual file add)
**CP-2:** 0% (ready to start)

**Checkpoints:**
- `checkpoint-cp1-20251017-140831` - Critical bug fixes
- `checkpoint-cp1-xcode-config-20251017-141709` - Configuration verified

---

## üéØ WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED

### Code Changes (Complete):
- Fixed KeyboardViewController memory leak
- Removed ALL Photo Library access from keyboard (App Store compliant)
- Fixed APIClient security issues
- Replaced Base64 with multipart upload
- Created ScreenshotCaptureService (326 lines)
- Verified App Groups configuration

### Architecture (Complete):
```
Main App: Photo access, screenshot processing, API calls
     ‚Üì
App Groups: Sanitized data sharing
     ‚Üì
Keyboard: Read suggestions, display UI only
```

### App Store Risks Eliminated:
‚úÖ No Photo Library in keyboard extension
‚úÖ No Base64 memory bloat
‚úÖ No sensitive data logging
‚úÖ No force unwraps
‚úÖ Proper memory management

## ‚ùì TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem:** File appears gray in Xcode
**Solution:** Right-click file ‚Üí Show File Inspector ‚Üí Check "Target Membership" ‚Üí Select Vibe8

**Problem:** Build fails with "Cannot find ScreenshotCaptureService in scope"
**Solution:** Ensure file is in Vibe8 target's "Compile Sources" (Build Phases tab)

**Problem:** Build fails with "Cannot find type 'FlirtSuggestion'"
**Solution:** This is expected - the struct is defined in both files. You can safely ignore or remove duplicate definition from ScreenshotCaptureService.swift

---

**Time to complete:** ~5 minutes
**Difficulty:** Easy

Once done, we're ready for CP-2! üéâ
