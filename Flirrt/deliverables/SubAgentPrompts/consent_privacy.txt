## Consent UX Copy Templates

### Voice Cloning Consent
**Primary Consent**:
"To create personalized voice messages, Flirrt needs to record and store a voice sample. This creates a unique voice clone that only you can use. Your voice data is encrypted and secured with industry-leading technology. You can delete your voice clone anytime, and we'll permanently remove all associated data within 24 hours."

**Withdrawal Process**:
"You can withdraw consent for voice cloning at any time in Settings > Privacy > Voice Data. This will immediately disable voice features and begin permanent deletion of your voice samples. The deletion process completes within 24 hours and cannot be reversed."

### Screenshot Analysis Consent
**Primary Consent**:
"Flirrt analyzes conversation screenshots you choose to share to provide personalized flirt suggestions. We never store your private conversations - screenshots are analyzed immediately and deleted within 24 hours. Only you control what gets analyzed, and you can disable this feature anytime."

**Data Usage Explanation**:
"When you share a screenshot, our AI analyzes conversation context, tone, and dynamics to suggest appropriate responses. No conversation content is stored permanently - only anonymized insights are kept to improve suggestions for all users."

### Personalization Consent
**Primary Consent**:
"Flirrt learns from your suggestion preferences to provide better recommendations over time. We track which suggestions you choose and modify, but never store your actual conversations or personal details. This helps us understand your communication style and improve suggestion quality."

**Control Options**:
"You can view, modify, or delete your personalization data anytime in Settings > Privacy > My Data. You can also reset your preferences to start fresh or disable personalization while keeping other features."
