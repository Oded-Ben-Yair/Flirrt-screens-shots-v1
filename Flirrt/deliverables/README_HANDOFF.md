## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Run the Claude-Code Master Prompt
1. Copy the entire content of `ClaudeCode_Flirrt_MasterPrompt.txt`
2. Paste into Claude-Code interface
3. Confirm implementation approach and deliverable requirements
4. Let Claude-Code generate the complete application architecture

### Step 2: Deploy Sub-Agents
Each sub-agent prompt in `/SubAgentPrompts/` can be used independently:
```
# Example: Deploy Screenshot Analyzer
Copy content from screenshot_analyzer.txt ‚Üí New Claude session
Provide screenshot analysis requests as per input schema
```

### Step 3: Implement APIs
Use the JSON specifications in `/API/` as OpenAPI documentation:
- Import into Postman for testing
- Generate server stubs using OpenAPI generators
- Validate request/response formats

### Step 4: Architecture Setup
1. Review Mermaid diagrams in `/Diagrams/` for system understanding
2. Use Terraform configurations for AWS infrastructure
3. Implement monitoring and security per `/policies/` guidelines

## Key Implementation Notes

### üîê Security & Compliance
- **iOS Full Access**: Required for keyboard extension functionality
- **Voice Consent**: Mandatory ElevenLabs consent with withdrawal options
