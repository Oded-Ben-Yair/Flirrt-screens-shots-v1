## üö® Important Notes

   - **For friends:** Use Internal Testing!

2. **Privacy Policy Required:**
   - Mandatory for TestFlight (even beta testing)
   - URL must be public and accessible
   - Must be added to App Store Connect before upload

3. **Bundle IDs Cannot Revert:**
   - Once changed to production, don't change back to .dev
   - Use production IDs from now on
   - Original .dev IDs will cause certificate mismatches

4. **TestFlight Limits:**
   - Internal testers: Must be added to App Store Connect team OR invited by email
   - Each internal tester can test for 90 days
   - Builds expire after 90 days (need to upload new build)
