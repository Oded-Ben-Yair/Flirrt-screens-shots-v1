   - Notification delivery rates
6. Presents plan:
   ```
   RECOMMENDATION: Option C (Phased)

   Phase 1 (Day 1-2):
   - Local notifications when keyboard generates suggestions
   - Test notification UI and user flow

   Phase 2 (Day 3-5):
   - Add APNs capability
   - Backend integration for remote notifications
   - Test end-to-end delivery

   Phase 3 (Day 6-7):
   - Analytics and optimization
   - A/B test notification copy

   RISKS: Low - phased approach minimizes risk
   EFFORT: 1 week with testing
   ```

**Result**: Ready-to-execute plan with timeline

   ```swift
   // FIX 1: Weak self in closure
   voiceService.observe { [weak self] result in
       guard let self = self else { return }
       // ...
   }

   // FIX 2: Clear cache on memory warning
   override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
       super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
       imageCache.removeAllObjects()
   }

   // FIX 3: Invalidate timer
   deinit {
       updateTimer?.invalidate()

   - No caching layer
   - Grok API called synchronously
7. Presents optimization plan:
   ```
   PHASE 1: Quick wins (1 day)
   - Add database indexes
   - Parallelize queries with Promise.all()
   - Expected improvement: 3-5s ‚Üí 1-2s

   PHASE 2: Caching (2 days)
