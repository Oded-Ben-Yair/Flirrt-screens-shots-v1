---

## 🚨 Known Issues & Technical Debt

### High Priority
1. **No end-to-end tests** - Only unit and integration tests
2. **Limited error tracking** - No crash reporting service integrated
3. **Database not fully implemented** - Using SQLite for MVP, PostgreSQL ready but not deployed

### Medium Priority
1. **Voice features disabled** - ElevenLabs integration complete but not exposed in UI
2. **No caching layer** - Every request hits AI APIs (cost concern)
3. **Memory management in keyboard** - Could be optimized further

### Low Priority
1. **UI polish needed** - Basic UI works but could be more refined
2. **Localization not implemented** - English only
3. **Analytics not integrated** - No usage tracking

---

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### iOS App
- **Cold start**: < 2s
- **Screenshot detection**: < 2s
- **API response**: 2-5s (AI processing)
- **Memory usage** (keyboard): ~20MB (limit: 60MB)

### Backend
- **Response time**: 2-5s (depends on AI API)
- **Throughput**: ~100 req/min (Render free tier)
- **Uptime**: 99.9% (Render SLA)
