    "intro": "A trading plan is your business blueprint - without it, you're gambling, not trading. Every successful trader has a written plan they follow religiously. Your plan serves as a roadmap that removes emotion from decisions and provides clear guidelines for every aspect of trading from market selection to risk management.",
    "section1_title": "Trading Plan Components and Structure",
    "section1_text": "Your plan needs six essential components: trading goals, risk tolerance, preferred markets, entry and exit rules, position sizing formula, and review schedule. Trading goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Instead of vague goals like \"make money,\" set concrete targets like \"achieve 15% annual return with maximum 20% drawdown.\" Risk tolerance defines how much you're willing to risk per trade and overall. Market selection specifies which instruments you'll trade based on capital, schedule, and expertise.",
    "section2_title": "Defining Entry and Exit Rules",
    "section2_text": "Entry and exit criteria must be specific and objective to eliminate guesswork. Define exact conditions for entries such as \"Buy when price breaks above resistance with RSI below 70 and volume 50% above average.\" Exit rules should include both profit targets and stop losses. For example: \"Exit when price hits 2:1 reward target OR breaks below entry day low.\" Having predetermined rules prevents emotional decisions during market fluctuations. Document multiple scenarios including trending markets, ranging markets, and high volatility periods.",
    "section3_title": "Backtesting and Paper Trading Your Plan",
    "section3_text": "Before risking real money, test your plan thoroughly using historical data and paper trading. Backtesting applies your rules to past markets to evaluate how the strategy would have performed. This reveals strengths, weaknesses, and potential issues. Paper trading allows testing in real-time market conditions without capital risk. This step identifies execution challenges and psychological factors that backtesting might miss. Test across different market conditions and timeframes to ensure robustness. Track key metrics like win rate, average win/loss ratio, maximum drawdown, and expectancy.",
    "section4_title": "Plan Review and Continuous Improvement",
    "section4_text": "Review your plan monthly to assess performance and identify areas for improvement. Markets evolve, and your plan should adapt accordingly - but don't change it after every losing trade. Give strategies adequate time to work through various market conditions. Review metrics including profitability, consistency, drawdown periods, and adherence to plan. Document lessons learned and pattern recognition improvements. Adjust position sizing as account grows. Refine entry and exit criteria based on performance data. Consider expanding to new markets or timeframes as skills develop.",
